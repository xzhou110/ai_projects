# AI-Course-Projects

This repository hosts five mini-projects completed during the course “From Users to Builders: Transform Yourself for the Age of AI.” Each project highlights a unique aspect of AI-driven development, reflecting both the course’s lessons and a personal initiative to explore end-to-end solutions with AI agents. The projects range from web scraping to crypto price plotting, GUI automation, and image processing—showcasing varied applications of data and AI techniques.

## Overview

By tackling real-world tasks with these smaller, focused projects, the goal is to demonstrate how AI agents can streamline workflows, enable rapid experimentation, and support continuous learning. Though each project differs in theme, they share a commitment to hands-on exploration and iterative improvement.

## Repository Structure

- **crypto-price-plot/**
  A project to retrieve and visualize cryptocurrency price data. Emphasizes data collection, simple plotting, and quick insights.

- **gui-automation/**
  Explores automated interactions with graphical user interfaces. Helps illustrate how AI agents (or script-based automations) can handle repetitive tasks.

- **basic-scraper/**
  Focuses on web scraping fundamentals, including parsing HTML, extracting information, and formatting data for analysis.

- **image-processing/**
  Demonstrates handling and manipulating images with basic computer vision or image transformation tasks.

- **project-five/**
  A placeholder for any future or additional mini-projects to come. Reflects the ongoing nature of this learning journey.

- **requirements.txt**
  Lists the Python dependencies needed to run these projects.

- **LICENSE**
  Provides the terms under which this repository is shared.

## Project Summaries

Each folder contains its own code and (where applicable) instructions on setup and usage. Projects may use AI agents for automation, code refactoring, or data manipulation. By reviewing them, you can see how agent-assisted approaches can speed up development, encourage cleaner code, and open new avenues for experimentation.
