Unmixing Diffusion for Self-Supervised Hyperspectral Image Denoising,"Haijin Zeng,Jiezhang Cao,Kai Zhang,Yongyong Chen,Hiep Luong,Wilfried Philips",Hyperspectral images (HSIs) have extensive applications in various fields such as medicine agriculture and industry. Nevertheless acquiring high signal-to-noise ratio HSI poses a challenge due to narrow-band spectral filtering. Consequently the importance of HSI denoising is substantial especially for snapshot hyperspectral imaging technology. While most previous HSI denoising methods are supervised creating supervised training datasets for the diverse scenes hyperspectral cameras and scan parameters is impractical. In this work we present Diff-Unmix a self-supervised denoising method for HSI using diffusion denoising generative models. Specifically Diff-Unmix addresses the challenge of recovering noise-degraded HSI through a fusion of Spectral Unmixing and conditional abundance generation. Firstly it employs a learnable block-based spectral unmixing strategy complemented by a pure transformer-based backbone. Then we introduce a self-supervised generative diffusion network to enhance abundance maps from the spectral unmixing block. This network reconstructs noise-free Unmixing probability distributions effectively mitigating noise-induced degradations within these components. Finally the reconstructed HSI is reconstructed through unmixing reconstruction by blending the diffusion-adjusted abundance map with the spectral endmembers. Experimental results on both simulated and real-world noisy datasets show that Diff-Unmix achieves state-of-the-art performance.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/html/Zeng_Unmixing_Diffusion_for_Self-Supervised_Hyperspectral_Image_Denoising_CVPR_2024_paper.html,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zeng_Unmixing_Diffusion_for_Self-Supervised_Hyperspectral_Image_Denoising_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/supplemental/Zeng_Unmixing_Diffusion_for_CVPR_2024_supplemental.pdf
Seeing the World through Your Eyes,"Hadi Alzayer,Kevin Zhang,Brandon Feng,Christopher A. Metzler,Jia-Bin Huang",The reflective nature of the human eye is an under-appreciated source of information about what the world around us looks like. By imaging the eyes of a moving person we capture multiple views of a scene outside the camera's direct line of sight through the reflections in the eyes. In this paper we reconstruct a radiance field beyond the camera's line of sight using portrait images containing eye reflections. This task is challenging due to 1) the difficulty of accurately estimating eye poses and 2) the entangled appearance of the iris textures and the scene reflections. To address these our method jointly optimizes the cornea poses the radiance field depicting the scene and the observer's eye iris texture. We further present a regularization prior on the iris texture to improve scene reconstruction quality. Through various experiments on synthetic and real-world captures featuring people with varied eye colors and lighting conditions we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach to recover the radiance field using cornea reflections.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/html/Alzayer_Seeing_the_World_through_Your_Eyes_CVPR_2024_paper.html,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Alzayer_Seeing_the_World_through_Your_Eyes_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/supplemental/Alzayer_Seeing_the_World_CVPR_2024_supplemental.pdf
DPMesh: Exploiting Diffusion Prior for Occluded Human Mesh Recovery,"Yixuan Zhu,Ao Li,Yansong Tang,Wenliang Zhao,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu",The recovery of occluded human meshes poses challenges for current methods due to the difficulty in extracting effective image features under severe occlusion. In this paper we introduce DPMesh an innovative framework for occluded human mesh recovery that capitalizes on the profound knowledge about object structure and spatial relationships embedded in a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. Unlike previous methods reliant on conventional backbones for vanilla feature extraction DPMesh seamlessly integrates the pre-trained denoising U-Net with potent priors as its image backbone and performs a single-step inference to provide occlusion-aware information. To enhance the perception capability for occluded poses DPMesh incorporates judicious guidance via condition injection which produces effective controls from 2D observations for the denoising U-Net. Furthermore we explore a dedicated noisy key-point reasoning approach to mitigate disturbances arising from occlusion and crowded scenarios. This strategy fully unleashes the perceptual capability of the diffusion prior thereby enhancing accuracy. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments affirm the efficacy of our framework as we outperform state-of-the-art methods on both occlusion-specific and standard datasets underscoring its ability to achieve precise and robust 3D human mesh recovery particularly in challenging scenarios involving occlusion and crowded scenes.

Ungeneralizable Examples,"Jingwen Ye,Xinchao Wang",The training of contemporary deep learning models heavily relies on publicly available data posing a risk of unauthorized access to online data and raising concerns about data privacy. Current approaches to creating unlearnable data involve incorporating small specially designed noises but these methods strictly limit data usability overlooking its potential usage in authorized scenarios. In this paper we extend the concept of unlearnable data to conditional data learnability and introduce UnGeneralizable Examples (UGEs). UGEs exhibit learnability for authorized users while maintaining unlearnability for potential hackers. The protector defines the authorized network and optimizes UGEs to match the gradients of the original data and its ungeneralizable version ensuring learnability. To prevent unauthorized learning UGEs are trained by maximizing a designated distance loss in a common feature space. Additionally to further safeguard the authorized side from potential attacks we introduce additional undistillation optimization. Experimental results on multiple datasets and various networks demonstrate that the proposed UGEs framework preserves data usability while reducing training performance on hacker networks even under different types of attacks.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/html/Ye_Ungeneralizable_Examples_CVPR_2024_paper.html,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ye_Ungeneralizable_Examples_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/supplemental/Ye_Ungeneralizable_Examples_CVPR_2024_supplemental.pdf
LaneCPP: Continuous 3D Lane Detection using Physical Priors,"Maximilian Pittner,Joel Janai,Alexandru P. Condurache",Monocular 3D lane detection has become a fundamental problem in the context of autonomous driving which comprises the tasks of finding the road surface and locating lane markings. One major challenge lies in a flexible but robust line representation capable of modeling complex lane structures while still avoiding unpredictable behavior. While previous methods rely on fully data-driven approaches we instead introduce a novel approach LaneCPP that uses a continuous 3D lane detection model leveraging physical prior knowledge about the lane structure and road geometry. While our sophisticated lane model is capable of modeling complex road structures it also shows robust behavior since physical constraints are incorporated by means of a regularization scheme that can be analytically applied to our parametric representation. Moreover we incorporate prior knowledge about the road geometry into the 3D feature space by modeling geometry-aware spatial features guiding the network to learn an internal road surface representation. In our experiments we show the benefits of our contributions and prove the meaningfulness of using priors to make 3D lane detection more robust. The results show that LaneCPP achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of F-Score and geometric errors.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/html/Pittner_LaneCPP_Continuous_3D_Lane_Detection_using_Physical_Priors_CVPR_2024_paper.html,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Pittner_LaneCPP_Continuous_3D_Lane_Detection_using_Physical_Priors_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/supplemental/Pittner_LaneCPP_Continuous_3D_CVPR_2024_supplemental.pdf
CityDreamer: Compositional Generative Model of Unbounded 3D Cities,"Haozhe Xie,Zhaoxi Chen,Fangzhou Hong,Ziwei Liu",3D city generation is a desirable yet challenging task since humans are more sensitive to structural distortions in urban environments. Additionally generating 3D cities is more complex than 3D natural scenes since buildings as objects of the same class exhibit a wider range of appearances compared to the relatively consistent appearance of objects like trees in natural scenes. To address these challenges we propose CityDreamer a compositional generative model designed specifically for unbounded 3D cities. Our key insight is that 3D city generation should be a composition of different types of neural fields: 1) various building instances and 2) background stuff such as roads and green lands. Specifically we adopt the bird's eye view scene representation and employ a volumetric render for both instance-oriented and stuff-oriented neural fields. The generative hash grid and periodic positional embedding are tailored as scene parameterization to suit the distinct characteristics of building instances and background stuff. Furthermore we contribute a suite of CityGen Datasets including OSM and GoogleEarth which comprises a vast amount of real-world city imagery to enhance the realism of the generated 3D cities both in their layouts and appearances. CityDreamer achieves state-of-the-art performance not only in generating realistic 3D cities but also in localized editing within the generated cities.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/html/Xie_CityDreamer_Compositional_Generative_Model_of_Unbounded_3D_Cities_CVPR_2024_paper.html,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xie_CityDreamer_Compositional_Generative_Model_of_Unbounded_3D_Cities_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/supplemental/Xie_CityDreamer_Compositional_Generative_CVPR_2024_supplemental.pdf
HEAL-SWIN: A Vision Transformer On The Sphere,"Oscar Carlsson,Jan E. Gerken,Hampus Linander,Heiner Spieß,Fredrik Ohlsson,Christoffer Petersson,Daniel Persson",High-resolution wide-angle fisheye images are becoming more and more important for robotics applications such as autonomous driving. However using ordinary convolutional neural networks or vision transformers on this data is problematic due to projection and distortion losses introduced when projecting to a rectangular grid on the plane. We introduce the HEAL-SWIN transformer which combines the highly uniform Hierarchical Equal Area iso-Latitude Pixelation (HEALPix) grid used in astrophysics and cosmology with the Hierarchical Shifted-Window (SWIN) transformer to yield an efficient and flexible model capable of training on high-resolution distortion-free spherical data. In HEAL-SWIN the nested structure of the HEALPix grid is used to perform the patching and windowing operations of the SWIN transformer enabling the network to process spherical representations with minimal computational overhead. We demonstrate the superior performance of our model on both synthetic and real automotive datasets as well as a selection of other image datasets for semantic segmentation depth regression and classification tasks. Our code is publicly available.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/html/Carlsson_HEAL-SWIN_A_Vision_Transformer_On_The_Sphere_CVPR_2024_paper.html,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Carlsson_HEAL-SWIN_A_Vision_Transformer_On_The_Sphere_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/supplemental/Carlsson_HEAL-SWIN_A_Vision_CVPR_2024_supplemental.pdf
3D Paintbrush: Local Stylization of 3D Shapes with Cascaded Score Distillation,"Dale Decatur,Itai Lang,Kfir Aberman,Rana Hanocka",We present 3D Paintbrush a technique for automatically texturing local semantic regions on meshes via text descriptions. Our method is designed to operate directly on meshes producing texture maps which seamlessly integrate into standard graphics pipelines. We opt to simultaneously produce a localization map (to specify the edit region) and a texture map which conforms to it. This approach improves the quality of both the localization and the stylization. To enhance the details and resolution of the textured area we leverage multiple stages of a cascaded diffusion model to supervise our local editing technique with generative priors learned from images at different resolutions. Our technique referred to as Cascaded Score Distillation (CSD) simultaneously distills scores at multiple resolutions in a cascaded fashion enabling control over both the granularity and global understanding of the supervision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D Paintbrush to locally texture different semantic regions on a variety of shapes.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/html/Decatur_3D_Paintbrush_Local_Stylization_of_3D_Shapes_with_Cascaded_Score_CVPR_2024_paper.html,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Decatur_3D_Paintbrush_Local_Stylization_of_3D_Shapes_with_Cascaded_Score_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/supplemental/Decatur_3D_Paintbrush_Local_CVPR_2024_supplemental.pdf
Test-Time Linear Out-of-Distribution Detection,"Ke Fan,Tong Liu,Xingyu Qiu,Yikai Wang,Lian Huai,Zeyu Shangguan,Shuang Gou,Fengjian Liu,Yuqian Fu,Yanwei Fu,Xingqun Jiang",Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection aims to address the excessive confidence prediction by neural networks by triggering an alert when the input sample deviates significantly from the training distribution (in-distribution) indicating that the output may not be reliable. Current OOD detection approaches explore all kinds of cues to identify OOD data such as finding irregular patterns in the feature space logit space gradient space or the raw image space. Surprisingly we observe a linear trend between the OOD score produced by current OOD detection algorithms and the network features on several datasets. We conduct a thorough investigation theoretically and empirically to analyze and understand the meaning of such a linear trend in OOD detection. This paper proposes a Robust Test-time Linear method (RTL) to utilize such linear trends like a `free lunch' when we have a batch of data to perform OOD detection. By using a simple linear regression as a test time adaptation we can make a more precise OOD prediction. We further propose an online variant of the proposed method which achieves promising performance and is more practical for real applications. Theoretical analysis is given to prove the effectiveness of our methods. Extensive experiments on several OOD datasets show the efficacy of RTL for OOD detection tasks significantly improving the results of base OOD detectors.

Guided Slot Attention for Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation,"Minhyeok Lee,Suhwan Cho,Dogyoon Lee,Chaewon Park,Jungho Lee,Sangyoun Lee",Unsupervised video object segmentation aims to segment the most prominent object in a video sequence. However the existence of complex backgrounds and multiple foreground objects make this task challenging. To address this issue we propose a guided slot attention network to reinforce spatial structural information and obtain better foreground-background separation. The foreground and background slots which are initialized with query guidance are iteratively refined based on interactions with template information. Furthermore to improve slot-template interaction and effectively fuse global and local features in the target and reference frames K-nearest neighbors filtering and a feature aggregation transformer are introduced. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two popular datasets. Additionally we demonstrate the robustness of the proposed model in challenging scenes through various comparative experiments.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/html/Lee_Guided_Slot_Attention_for_Unsupervised_Video_Object_Segmentation_CVPR_2024_paper.html,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Lee_Guided_Slot_Attention_for_Unsupervised_Video_Object_Segmentation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf,
Unsupervised Blind Image Deblurring Based on Self-Enhancement,"Lufei Chen,Xiangpeng Tian,Shuhua Xiong,Yinjie Lei,Chao Ren",Significant progress in image deblurring has been achieved by deep learning methods especially the remarkable performance of supervised models on paired synthetic data. However real-world quality degradation is more complex than synthetic datasets and acquiring paired data in real-world scenarios poses significant challenges. To address these challenges we propose a novel unsupervised image deblurring framework based on self-enhancement. The framework progressively generates improved pseudo-sharp and blurry image pairs without the need for real paired datasets and the generated image pairs with higher qualities can be used to enhance the performance of the reconstructor. To ensure the generated blurry images are closer to the real blurry images we propose a novel re-degradation principal component consistency loss which enforces the principal components of the generated low-quality images to be similar to those of re-degraded images from the original sharp ones. Furthermore we introduce the self-enhancement strategy that significantly improves deblurring performance without increasing the computational complexity of network during inference. Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world blurry datasets we demonstrate the superiority of our approach over other state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/html/Chen_Unsupervised_Blind_Image_Deblurring_Based_on_Self-Enhancement_CVPR_2024_paper.html,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_Unsupervised_Blind_Image_Deblurring_Based_on_Self-Enhancement_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/supplemental/Chen_Unsupervised_Blind_Image_CVPR_2024_supplemental.pdf
Action Detection via an Image Diffusion Process,"Lin Geng Foo,Tianjiao Li,Hossein Rahmani,Jun Liu",Action detection aims to localize the starting and ending points of action instances in untrimmed videos and predict the classes of those instances. In this paper we make the observation that the outputs of the action detection task can be formulated as images. Thus from a novel perspective we tackle action detection via a three-image generation process to generate starting point ending point and action-class predictions as images via our proposed Action Detection Image Diffusion (ADI-Diff) framework. Furthermore since our images differ from natural images and exhibit special properties we further explore a Discrete Action-Detection Diffusion Process and a Row-Column Transformer design to better handle their processing. Our ADI-Diff framework achieves state-of-the-art results on two widely-used datasets.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/html/Foo_Action_Detection_via_an_Image_Diffusion_Process_CVPR_2024_paper.html,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Foo_Action_Detection_via_an_Image_Diffusion_Process_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/supplemental/Foo_Action_Detection_via_CVPR_2024_supplemental.pdf
Programmable Motion Generation for Open-Set Motion Control Tasks,"Hanchao Liu,Xiaohang Zhan,Shaoli Huang,Tai-Jiang Mu,Ying Shan",Character animation in real-world scenarios necessitates a variety of constraints such as trajectories key-frames interactions etc. Existing methodologies typically treat single or a finite set of these constraint(s) as separate control tasks. These methods are often specialized and the tasks they address are rarely extendable or customizable. We categorize these as solutions to the close-set motion control problem. In response to the complexity of practical motion control we propose and attempt to solve the open-set motion control problem. This problem is characterized by an open and fully customizable set of motion control tasks. To address this we introduce a new paradigm programmable motion generation. In this paradigm any given motion control task is broken down into a combination of atomic constraints. These constraints are then programmed into an error function that quantifies the degree to which a motion sequence adheres to them. We utilize a pre-trained motion generation model and optimize its latent code to minimize the error function of the generated motion. Consequently the generated motion not only inherits the prior of the generative model but also satisfies the requirements of the compounded constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach can generate high-quality motions when addressing a wide range of unseen tasks. These tasks encompass motion control by motion dynamics geometric constraints physical laws interactions with scenes objects or the character's own body parts etc. All of these are achieved in a unified approach without the need for ad-hoc paired training data collection or specialized network designs. During the programming of novel tasks we observed the emergence of new skills beyond those of the prior model. With the assistance of large language models we also achieved automatic programming. We hope that this work will pave the way for the motion control of general AI agents.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/html/Liu_Programmable_Motion_Generation_for_Open-Set_Motion_Control_Tasks_CVPR_2024_paper.html,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_Programmable_Motion_Generation_for_Open-Set_Motion_Control_Tasks_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/supplemental/Liu_Programmable_Motion_Generation_CVPR_2024_supplemental.zip
SCE-MAE: Selective Correspondence Enhancement with Masked Autoencoder for Self-Supervised Landmark Estimation,"Kejia Yin,Varshanth Rao,Ruowei Jiang,Xudong Liu,Parham Aarabi,David B. Lindell",Self-supervised landmark estimation is a challenging task that demands the formation of locally distinct feature representations to identify sparse facial landmarks in the absence of annotated data. To tackle this task existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods (1) extract coarse features from backbones that are trained with instance-level self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms which neglect the dense prediction nature of the task (2) aggregate them into memory-intensive hypercolumn formations and (3) supervise lightweight projector networks to naively establish full local correspondences among all pairs of spatial features. In this paper we introduce SCE-MAE a framework that (1) leverages the MAE [??] a region-level SSL method that naturally better suits the landmark prediction task (2) operates on the vanilla feature map instead of on expensive hypercolumns and (3) employs a Correspondence Approximation and Refinement Block (CARB) that utilizes a simple density peak clustering algorithm and our proposed Locality-Constrained Repellence Loss to directly hone only select local correspondences. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that SCE-MAE is highly effective and robust outperforming existing SOTA methods by large margins of 20%-44% on the landmark matching and 9%-15% on the landmark detection tasks.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/html/Yin_SCE-MAE_Selective_Correspondence_Enhancement_with_Masked_Autoencoder_for_Self-Supervised_Landmark_CVPR_2024_paper.html,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yin_SCE-MAE_Selective_Correspondence_Enhancement_with_Masked_Autoencoder_for_Self-Supervised_Landmark_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/supplemental/Yin_SCE-MAE_Selective_Correspondence_CVPR_2024_supplemental.pdf
LAKE-RED: Camouflaged Images Generation by Latent Background Knowledge Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion,"Pancheng Zhao,Peng Xu,Pengda Qin,Deng-Ping Fan,Zhicheng Zhang,Guoli Jia,Bowen Zhou,Jufeng Yang",Camouflaged vision perception is an important vision task with numerous practical applications. Due to the expensive collection and labeling costs this community struggles with a major bottleneck that the species category of its datasets is limited to a small number of object species. However the existing camouflaged generation methods require specifying the background manually thus failing to extend the camouflaged sample diversity in a low-cost manner. In this paper we propose a Latent Background Knowledge Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion (LAKE-RED) for camouflaged image generation. To our knowledge our contributions mainly include: (1) For the first time we propose a camouflaged generation paradigm that does not need to receive any background inputs. (2) Our LAKE-RED is the first knowledge retrieval-augmented method with interpretability for camouflaged generation in which we propose an idea that knowledge retrieval and reasoning enhancement are separated explicitly to alleviate the task-specific challenges. Moreover our method is not restricted to specific foreground targets or backgrounds offering a potential for extending camouflaged vision perception to more diverse domains. (3) Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing approaches generating more realistic camouflage images.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/html/Zhao_LAKE-RED_Camouflaged_Images_Generation_by_Latent_Background_Knowledge_Retrieval-Augmented_Diffusion_CVPR_2024_paper.html,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhao_LAKE-RED_Camouflaged_Images_Generation_by_Latent_Background_Knowledge_Retrieval-Augmented_Diffusion_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf,
TIGER: Time-Varying Denoising Model for 3D Point Cloud Generation with Diffusion Process,"Zhiyuan Ren,Minchul Kim,Feng Liu,Xiaoming Liu",Recently diffusion models have emerged as a new powerful generative method for 3D point cloud generation tasks. However few works study the effect of the architecture of the diffusion model in the 3D point cloud resorting to the typical UNet model developed for 2D images. Inspired by the wide adoption of Transformers we study the complementary role of convolution (from UNet) and attention (from Transformers). We discover that their respective importance change according to the timestep in the diffusion process. At early stage attention has an outsized influence because Transformers are found to generate the overall shape more quickly and at later stages when adding fine detail convolution starts having a larger impact on the generated point cloud's local surface quality. In light of this observation we propose a time-varying two-stream denoising model combined with convolution layers and transformer blocks. We generate an optimizable mask from each timestep to reweigh global and local features obtaining time-varying fused features. Experimentally we demonstrate that our proposed method quantitatively outperforms other state-of-the-art methods regarding visual quality and diversity.

ConTex-Human: Free-View Rendering of Human from a Single Image with Texture-Consistent Synthesis,"Xiangjun Gao,Xiaoyu Li,Chaopeng Zhang,Qi Zhang,Yanpei Cao,Ying Shan,Long Quan",In this work we propose a method to address the challenge of rendering a 3D human from a single image in a free-view manner. Some existing approaches could achieve this by using generalizable pixel-aligned implicit fields to reconstruct a textured mesh of a human or by employing a 2D diffusion model as guidance with the Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) method to lift the 2D image into 3D space. However a generalizable implicit field often results in an over-smooth texture field while the SDS method tends to lead to a texture-inconsistent novel view with the input image. In this paper we introduce a texture-consistent back view synthesis method that could transfer the reference image content to the back view through depth-guided mutual self-attention. With this method we could achieve high-fidelity and texture-consistent human rendering from a single image. Moreover to alleviate the color distortion that occurs in the side region we propose a  visibility-aware patch consistency regularization  combined with the synthesized back view texture. Experiments conducted on both real and synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and show that our approach outperforms previous baseline methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/html/Gao_ConTex-Human_Free-View_Rendering_of_Human_from_a_Single_Image_with_CVPR_2024_paper.html,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Gao_ConTex-Human_Free-View_Rendering_of_Human_from_a_Single_Image_with_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/supplemental/Gao_ConTex-Human_Free-View_Rendering_CVPR_2024_supplemental.pdf
UFineBench: Towards Text-based Person Retrieval with Ultra-fine Granularity,"Jialong Zuo,Hanyu Zhou,Ying Nie,Feng Zhang,Tianyu Guo,Nong Sang,Yunhe Wang,Changxin Gao",Existing text-based person retrieval datasets often have relatively coarse-grained text annotations. This hinders the model to comprehend the fine-grained semantics of query texts in real scenarios. To address this problem we contribute a new benchmark named UFineBench for text-based person retrieval with ultra-fine granularity. Firstly we construct a new dataset named UFine6926. We collect a large number of person images and manually annotate each image with two detailed textual descriptions averaging 80.8 words each. The average word count is three to four times that of the previous datasets. In addition of standard in-domain evaluation we also propose a special evaluation paradigm more representative of real scenarios. It contains a new evaluation set with cross domains cross textual granularity and cross textual styles named UFine3C and a new evaluation metric for accurately measuring retrieval ability named mean Similarity Distribution (mSD). Moreover we propose CFAM a more efficient algorithm especially designed for text-based person retrieval with ultra fine-grained texts. It achieves fine granularity mining by adopting a shared cross-modal granularity decoder and hard negative match mechanism. With standard in-domain evaluation CFAM establishes competitive performance across various datasets especially on our ultra fine-grained UFine6926. Furthermore by evaluating on UFine3C we demonstrate that training on our UFine6926 significantly improves generalization to real scenarios compared with other coarse-grained datasets. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Zplusdragon/UFineBench.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/html/Zuo_UFineBench_Towards_Text-based_Person_Retrieval_with_Ultra-fine_Granularity_CVPR_2024_paper.html,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zuo_UFineBench_Towards_Text-based_Person_Retrieval_with_Ultra-fine_Granularity_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/supplemental/Zuo_UFineBench_Towards_Text-based_CVPR_2024_supplemental.pdf
Efficient Hyperparameter Optimization with Adaptive Fidelity Identification,"Jiantong Jiang,Zeyi Wen,Atif Mansoor,Ajmal Mian",Hyperparameter Optimization and Neural Architecture Search are powerful in attaining state-of-the-art machine learning models with Bayesian Optimization (BO) standing out as a mainstream method. Extending BO into the multi-fidelity setting has been an emerging research topic in this field but faces the challenge of determining an appropriate fidelity for each hyperparameter configuration to fit the surrogate model. To tackle the challenge we propose a multi-fidelity BO method named FastBO which excels in adaptively deciding the fidelity for each configuration and providing strong performance while ensuring efficient resource usage. These advantages are achieved through our proposed techniques based on the concepts of efficient point and saturation point for each configuration which can be obtained from the empirical learning curve of the configuration estimated from early observations. Extensive experiments demonstrate FastBO's superior anytime performance and efficiency in identifying high-quality configurations and architectures. We also show that our method provides a way to extend any single-fidelity method to the multi-fidelity setting highlighting the wide applicability of our approach.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/html/Jiang_Efficient_Hyperparameter_Optimization_with_Adaptive_Fidelity_Identification_CVPR_2024_paper.html,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Jiang_Efficient_Hyperparameter_Optimization_with_Adaptive_Fidelity_Identification_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/supplemental/Jiang_Efficient_Hyperparameter_Optimization_CVPR_2024_supplemental.pdf
ASH: Animatable Gaussian Splats for Efficient and Photoreal Human Rendering,"Haokai Pang,Heming Zhu,Adam Kortylewski,Christian Theobalt,Marc Habermann",Real-time rendering of photorealistic and controllable human avatars stands as a cornerstone in Computer Vision and Graphics. While recent advances in neural implicit rendering have unlocked unprecedented photorealism for digital avatars real-time performance has mostly been demonstrated for static scenes only. To address this we propose ASH an animatable Gaussian splatting approach for photorealistic rendering of dynamic humans in real time. We parameterize the clothed human as animatable 3D Gaussians which can be efficiently splatted into image space to generate the final rendering. However naively learning the Gaussian parameters in 3D space poses a severe challenge in terms of compute. Instead we attach the Gaussians onto a deformable character model and learn their parameters in 2D texture space which allows leveraging efficient 2D convolutional architectures that easily scale with the required number of Gaussians. We benchmark ASH with competing methods on pose-controllable avatars demonstrating that our method outperforms existing real-time methods by a large margin and shows comparable or even better results than offline methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/html/Pang_ASH_Animatable_Gaussian_Splats_for_Efficient_and_Photoreal_Human_Rendering_CVPR_2024_paper.html,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Pang_ASH_Animatable_Gaussian_Splats_for_Efficient_and_Photoreal_Human_Rendering_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/supplemental/Pang_ASH_Animatable_Gaussian_CVPR_2024_supplemental.pdf
